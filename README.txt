= PGR Video Recorder =
This is a small application that records raw video from PGR cameras using the flycapture library. 
I wrote this tool because I needed it and could not find an application that does this. 
It is very minimal right now.

== Build ==
Currently only tested on Linux. 

=== Linux ===
To build the project you can impost it into eclipse. 
Add flycapture and gtk libraries and link to their binaries. 
You should now be able to compile and run this little application.

== License ==
The application is release under terms and conditions of GPLv3.
